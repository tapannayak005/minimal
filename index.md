# About
As a Test Specialist at IBM, I design, develop, and implement test plans, test cases, and test processes for various projects, ensuring high-quality and swift corrective actions. I have worked on an internal project that enhanced my knowledge and skills as a software tester, and enabled me to collaborate with different teams and stakeholders. 

I am also pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science using Machine Learning and AI at Liverpool John Moores University, where I am learning how to apply advanced analytical techniques and algorithms to solve real-world problems. I have a Master of Computer Applications in Computer Science from Silicon Institute of Technology, where I gained a strong foundation in programming, data structures, and algorithms. 

I am passionate about computer vision and cloud engineering, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and tools. I enjoy playing video games with challenges and storylines in my free time, as they stimulate my creativity and problem-solving skills. My goal is to leverage my testing and data science skills to create innovative and impactful solutions for the industry.
